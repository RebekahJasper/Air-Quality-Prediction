# Air-Quality-Prediction
Project Title:
Air Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning and Interactive Visualization

Description:
This project focuses on predicting urban air quality indices (AQI) using machine learning techniques. The workflow includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and interactive dashboard development. Using Python and the Prophet library, a time series model was trained on key air pollution indicators to forecast AQI for future periods. An interactive Streamlit dashboard was developed, allowing users to visualize past and predicted AQI values, adjust forecast horizons, and evaluate model performance using real-world metrics.

Highlights:

Cleaned and preprocessed a real-world air quality dataset, handling missing and anomalous values.

Engineered features based on core pollutant concentrations.

Built a robust time-series forecasting model using Prophet to predict future AQI levels.

Evaluated the model with metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R² to ensure reliable predictions.

Developed and deployed a user-friendly Streamlit dashboard for dynamic visualization and results exploration.
